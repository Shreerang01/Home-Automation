# Home Automation System

Home automation systems have gained significant popularity in recent years, offering convenience, energy efficiency, and security for homeowners. This project demonstrates a home automation system using an Arduino UNO, various sensors, and actuators. The system combines multiple functionalities, including lighting control, motion detection, door control using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor, gas detection for fire alarm, and automatic night lighting. It is a practical example of the Internet of Things (IoT) in action, improving the quality of life and safety within a home.
